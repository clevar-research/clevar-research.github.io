## Enhancing Online Learning with Virtual Instructors

This study explores how online educational videos can be improved by adding a Virtual Instructorâ€”an on-screen conversational agent that allows students to ask questions and receive real-time explanations related to the video content.

The study focused on the challenges commonly associated with asynchronous learning, such as limited interaction, low engagement, and the difficulty of seeking clarification while watching. By introducing a Virtual Instructor, the goal was to investigate whether learners benefit from having a more interactive experience during video-based instruction.

Participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions:

- [Control condition](https://example.com/control): Participants watched a standard educational video with no additional support.
- [Instructor condition](https://example.com/instructor): Participants watched the same video with access to an interactive Virtual Instructor.

This work is part of a broader effort to explore new ways of supporting students in online and self-paced learning environments.
